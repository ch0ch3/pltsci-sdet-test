This test suite is designed to validate the functionality of the Hoover Cleaning Service. It includes both unit tests using Cucumber and end-to-end tests using Cypress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/choch3/hoover-cleaning-service-tests.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    cd hoover-cleaning-service-tests

3. Install the dependencies:

    npm install

End-to-End Tests (Cypress)
To run the end-to-end tests using Cypress, follow these steps:

Start your application (Hoover Cleaning Service) on http://localhost:8080.

Run the Cypress test runner: npm run test:cypress

In the Cypress test runner window, click on the desired test file (e.g., service.feature) to execute the test.

Note: Before running the Cypress tests, make sure you have adjusted the test code in service.feature to match your application's implementation.
